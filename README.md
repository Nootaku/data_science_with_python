# Data Science with Python
This repo is all about fiddling with multiple data science tools for Python. I also want to gain some insight into Machine Learning algorithms (what they are, how they work and how to build one from scratch).

So how do we do this ?

1. First I will have fun with `Numpy` and `Pandas`. The idea is to get comfortable with datasets, their structure and methods.
   1. [Numpy](./numpy/numpy_documentation.md)
   2. [Pandas](./pandas/pandas_documentation.md)
2. Then we will have a look at how to represent the data using data visualization. This will guide us through `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn` and `Plotly`.
   1. [Matplotlib](./matplotlib/matplotlib_documentation.md)
   2. [Seaborn](./matplotlib/seaborn_documentation)
   3. [Plotly](./plotly_cufflinks/plotly_documentation.md)
